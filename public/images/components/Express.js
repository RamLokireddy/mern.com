     <h1>Express JS Overview</h1>
     <li>ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends. With ExpressJS, you need not worry about low level protocols, processes, etc.
         </li>
         <h1>What is Express?</h1><li>
Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications. It provides us the tools that are required to build our app. It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on npm, which can be directly plugged into Express.

Express was developed by TJ Holowaychuk and is maintained by the Node.js foundation and numerous open source contributors.</li>
<h1>Why Express?</h1>
<li>


Unlike its competitors like Rails and Django, which have an opinionated way of building applications, Express has no "best way" to do something. It is very flexible and pluggable.

<b>Pug</b>
Pug (earlier known as Jade) is a terse language for writing HTML templates. It −

Produces HTML
Supports dynamic code
Supports reusability (DRY)
It is one of the most popular template language used with Express.

<h1>ExpressJS - Environment</h1>
<li>
    
    we will learn how to start developing and using the Express Framework. To start with, you should have the Node and the npm (node package manager) installed. If you don’t already have these, go to the Node setup to install node on your local system. Confirm that node and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal.

node --version
npm --version
You should get an output similar to the following.

v5.0.0
3.5.2
Now that we have Node and npm set up, let us understand what npm is and how to use it.
