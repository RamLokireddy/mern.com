We dig into these principles later in the course.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n  <h1>why do we use it</h1>\r\n  <p>React is a JavaScript framework. Using the framework is as simple as including a JavaScript file in our HTML and using the React exports in our application's JavaScript.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Although it might look a little scary, the JavaScript code is a single line that dynamically adds Hello world to the page.</p> \r\n  <p>Note that we only needed to include a handful of JavaScript files to get everything working.</p>\r\n<h1>How does it work!!!</h1>\r\n<p>Unlike many of its predecessors, React operates not directly on the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) immediately, but on a virtual DOM. </p>\r\n<p>That is, rather than manipulating the document in a browser after changes to our data (which can be quite slow) it resolves changes on a DOM built and run entirely in memory.</p>\r\n<p> After the virtual DOM has been updated, React intelligently determines what changes to make to the actual browser's DOM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The React Virtual DOM exists entirely in-memory and is a representation of the web browser's DOM. </p>\r\n<p>Because of this, when we write a React component, we're not writing directly to the DOM, but we're writing a virtual component that React will turn into the DOM.</p>\r\n<h3>What are components</h3>\r\n<p>Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these.</p> \r\n<p>Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.</p>\r\n<h3>your first component</h3>\r\n          <b><mark> const Greeting = () => Hello World today!</mark></b>;\r\n         <p> This is a functional component (called Greeting) written using ES6’s arrow function syntax that takes no props and returns an H1 tag with the text “Hello World today!” </p>\r\n\r\n         <p>In Chapter 1, you learnt how to set up a React App using the create-react-app tool. We’ll take a step back momentarily and use a basic setup to learn the basics of components. </p> \r\n         <p>You can find the starter app here and clone it to your computer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to run the code examples in this chapter on your machine, you first have to install a server globally using nodeJs. Below is the command to install the http-server on your machine. </p> \r\n<u>Open your terminal and run:-</u>\r\n<b><mark>npm install http-server -g</mark></b>\r\n<p>Open the index.html file within the Chapter 2/starter-code folder in your text editor and add the Greeting component where you see the instructions to do so.</p>\r\n<p> Below is a code snippet of how your index.html file should look like after this change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the starter-code folder run the command below to start the server:-</p>\r\n<p><mark>http-server .</mark></p>\r\n<p>Open the url within the terminal in your browser and you should see the text “Hello World Today!”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you make changes to the code and they are not shown in the browser even after refresh.</p> \r\n<p>Try hard refreshing that tab or page.\r\nYou did it! You created and rendered your first component.\r\n</p> \r\n<p>Let’s take a closer look to help us understand what just happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your index.html should look like this at this point</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div className=\"col-lg-13 col-sm-14 mb-10\">\r\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"http://placehold.it/500x300\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                    </div>\r\n<a href='https://reactjs.org/'><u>Click here to know more about React JS</u></a>\r\n\r\n    \r\n    </React.Fragment>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\nexport default React1;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
